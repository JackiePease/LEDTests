# LEDTests
Mainly Arduino code to help me test LED circuits:

**Button_LED** - lights up pixels one by one as a momentary button is pressed, so that you can tell which one is next in line in an irregular layout.

**October_LED_Project** - This is a bit of a WIP still, but some useful (to me) examples of FastLED use, and arrays.
